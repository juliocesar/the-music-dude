# The Music Dude

I saw that head while browsing [The Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com) and thought of this.

Peruse at your leisure. I tried to make the code as fun as possible. Except for that part where
I'm overriding `Object`. Twice. Peace!

# How to use this

Point your _iPhone_ at [awesomebydesign.com/the-music-dude](http://awesomebydesign.com/the-music-dude). Yeah,
you heard it right. Support for other mobile OSs is purely accidental as of right now. I blame Google for making
the worst emulator ever seen in mankind's history.

Though I'd be happy to accept patches fixing that.
